# Appendix: Test cases for system testing

This appendix consists of a few main documents and several test case documents. Together, they are used to organize, present and help manage test cases for system testing.

Here's a list of the types of documents and their purposes:

- 01 `README.md` file (this one you are reading), that serves as a table of contents
- 01 [how-to.md](how-to.md) file, that explains how to organize/manage system testing
- 01 [stc-template.md](stc-template.md) file (a template for test case files)
- several `stc-0000.md`, `stc-0001.md`, etc., test case files.

The main table below lists and links all existing test case files in use. If one of the existing tests is removed, a second table to list removed tests should be placed right after the one below. This list of removed tests in the second table is needed so we keep track of existing UIDs from them don't accidentally reuse their UIDs.
